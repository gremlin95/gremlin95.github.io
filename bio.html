	<h1>INSATIABLY CURIOUS. <br> EXCEPTIONALLY CREATIVE. <br> PERPETUALLY PLUGGED IN. <br> AVID DREAMER.</h1>
	<h6>IOW- I'm F#&$@*g Awesome. </h6>.
	
	<p><h5> 
	<P><H5> I am a front end developer and programmer by profession. Coding is love. Im exceptionally creative. Self proclaimed, yes, but, I'll tell you how.</P>
<p>It's simple, I think out of the box. The conventional rules never apply to me. If there's a wall with no way to the other side,
 I wouldn't be beating on it invain, I'll build a machine to catapult me to the other side. 
It helps that I'm insatiably curious. I have asked why and how all my  life that all the answers have broadned my mind. 
That's how I can find fresh and new solutions to problems and work myself out of anything.</p>

 <p>My imagination knows no limits. I'm an avid dreamer. Rooted I believe in my excessive reading and love for travel.
 Adapting is a special skill I posess which has come in handy more times than I can count in life.
 Thats how I manage to go around the country on the lowest budget and energy bars.</p>
 <p>I have a good sense of humour. Life isn't easy without some laughs specially at your own personal blunders. It does border on a little dark sometimes but hey, who's judging.
 I love to keep things simple in my life. I despise over the top drama and avoid it at all costs.</p> 
<p>I firmly agree with Bill Gates when he said "I will always find a lazy person to do a difficult job because he will find an easy way to do it"
I can personally attest to that logic.
 When I do something it will definitely be the easiest way but, the end result will be perfect. Trust me, a lazy perfectionist is the best combo.</p>
<p>As evident to you by now, I'm an awesomazing human being!</h5><p>
